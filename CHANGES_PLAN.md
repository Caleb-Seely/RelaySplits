## ?? **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **UI Changes to Verify**
- [ ] Login forms in DemoLanding have reduced padding (p-6 instead of p-8)
- [ ] Start time input is centered in SetupWizard and TeamSetup
- [ ] "Van tabs filter the grid only" text is removed from RunnerAssignmentModal
- [ ] View only button shows eye icon instead of text in Dashboard footer
- [ ] Sync button is removed from Dashboard footer
- [ ] Cards/table toggle has proper contrast on mobile
- [ ] Admin secret triangle is inline with text
- [ ] Progress bars have shimmer effect
- [ ] Team Settings header has reduced padding
- [ ] "When does your wave start?" is centered

### **Functionality Changes to Verify**
- [ ] Finish Race button only appears when leg 36 has start time but no finish time
- [ ] Race Completed card only shows when leg 36 has actual finish time
- [ ] Undo button text shows "Undo Last Start/Finish"
- [ ] Confetti animation works when clicking Start Runner
- [ ] Invite token copy button works and shows eye icon
- [ ] "Share Invite Token" button text is correct
- [ ] Race condition protection prevents multiple runners from starting

### **Mobile Testing**
- [ ] Cards/table toggle is visible on mobile
- [ ] All buttons are properly sized for touch
- [ ] Text is readable on small screens
- [ ] Progress bars animate correctly on mobile

### **Edge Cases to Test**
- [ ] What happens when leg 36 starts but doesn't finish?
- [ ] What happens when race is actually completed?
- [ ] Can multiple runners be started simultaneously?
- [ ] Does confetti work on all devices?
- [ ] Does shimmer effect work on all browsers?

## ?? **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**

### **High Priority (Critical Functionality)**
1. Finish Race button logic
2. Race completed logic
3. Confetti debug button
4. Race condition protection

### **Medium Priority (UI/UX)**
1. Progress bar shimmer
2. Footer icon changes
3. Text changes and centering
4. Mobile contrast fixes

### **Low Priority (Polish)**
1. Padding adjustments
2. Text removal
3. Minor styling tweaks

## ?? **NOTES**

- The canvas-confetti library has been installed
- CSS shimmer effect has been added to index.css
- Most UI changes have been completed
- Logic changes for race completion need careful testing
- Mobile testing is crucial for all changes

## ?? **DEBUGGING TIPS**

1. **Confetti not working**: Check browser console for errors, verify canvas-confetti import
2. **Shimmer not animating**: Check if progress-shimmer class is applied
3. **Race logic issues**: Test with different leg states (started, finished, not started)
4. **Mobile issues**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
5. **Icon issues**: Verify Lucide React icons are properly imported
