# Code Review and Pre-Launch Audit

This document outlines critical issues to address before publishing the RelayTracker application, as well as recommended enhancements for after launch.

---

## Before Publishing

This section covers issues that **must** be addressed to ensure security, stability, and a positive user experience. 

### 1. Security & Privacy

*   **Environment Variables**: Ensure no sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, secrets) is hardcoded. Use a `.env` file for local development and environment variables in production. Create a `.env.example` file to show what variables are needed.
*   **Supabase RLS**: Review and tighten Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase. Ensure users can only access and modify data they own.
*   **Input Validation**: Implement strict validation on all user inputs (forms, API requests) to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks. Libraries like `zod` or `yup` can be helpful.
*   **Authentication**: Verify that all protected routes and API endpoints properly enforce authentication and authorization.

### 2. Dependencies

*   **Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` or `bun audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. Update any insecure packages.
*   **Unused Dependencies**: Remove any packages listed in `package.json` that are no longer used in the project to reduce bundle size and attack surface.
*   **Conflicting Lock Files**: You have both `package-lock.json` (npm/pnpm) and `bun.lockb` (Bun). This can lead to inconsistent dependency installations between developers or in CI/CD. **Choose one package manager and delete the other lock file.**

### 3. Performance

*   **Code Splitting**: Review your Vite/React setup to ensure code-splitting is implemented for pages and large components. This will improve initial load times.
*   **Image Optimization**: Compress and resize images. Use modern formats like WebP.
*   **Bundle Size**: Analyze your production bundle size. Look for large libraries that could be replaced with smaller alternatives.

### 4. Error Handling & Stability

*   **Global Error Boundary**: Implement a global error boundary in your React application to catch unexpected runtime errors and display a user-friendly message instead of a white screen.
*   **API Error Handling**: Ensure all `fetch` or other API calls have proper `.catch()` blocks to handle network errors, server errors (5xx), and client errors (4xx).
*   **Logging**: Add a logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to capture and monitor production errors.

### 5. Testing

*   **Critical Path Testing**: Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows, such as user login, team creation, and runner assignment.
*   **Unit/Integration Tests**: Add unit tests for complex business logic (e.g., in your `hooks` and `utils`) and integration tests for components with complex state management.

### 6. Build & Deployment

*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment. This will improve reliability and speed up releases.
*   **Production Build**: Ensure you are deploying a production-optimized build (`npm run build` or `bun run build`).

## After Publishing

This section includes enhancements that can be addressed post-launch to improve the application over time.

### 1. Code Quality & Refactoring

*   **Refactor Large Components**: Break down large components (if any) into smaller, reusable ones to improve maintainability.
*   **TypeScript Strictness**: Enable stricter TypeScript checks in `tsconfig.json` (`"strict": true`) and resolve any resulting errors to improve type safety.
*   **Code Consistency**: Ensure the codebase follows the formatting and linting rules defined in `eslint.config.js` consistently.

### 2. UX/UI Polish

*   **Loading & Empty States**: Add more detailed loading indicators (skeletons) and helpful empty states throughout the UI.
*   **Accessibility (a11y)**: Conduct an accessibility audit to ensure the app is usable for people with disabilities (e.g., proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
*   **Responsive Design**: Further refine the responsive design for a wider range of mobile and tablet devices.

### 3. Documentation

*   **Component Documentation**: Add comments or use a tool like Storybook to document complex components and their props.
*   **Architecture Overview**: Expand the `README.md` with a high-level overview of the project architecture, setup instructions, and deployment process.

### 4. Scalability & Optimizations

*   **Database Optimization**: Review Supabase query performance. Add indexes to columns that are frequently queried.
*   **State Management**: For complex state that is shared across many components, consider if a more robust state management library (like Zustand, Redux) is needed to simplify logic currently handled by `useContext` or prop-drilling.
*   **Real-time Features**: Investigate enhancing the `useSupabaseSync` with real-time subscriptions for a more collaborative experience, if applicable.
