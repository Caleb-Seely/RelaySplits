# Phase 1 Testing Plan - Critical Bug Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy to validate the fixes for the critical bugs identified in Phase 1 of the LONG_TERM_PLAN.md.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Multiple devices (at least 2 phones, 1 tablet, 1 desktop)
- Different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Network conditions (WiFi, cellular, offline scenarios)
- Race simulation data

### Test Data Setup
```typescript
// Sample race data for testing
const testRaceData = {
  startTime: new Date('2025-01-15T08:00:00Z').getTime(),
  runners: [
    { id: 1, name: "Alice Johnson", pace: 420, van: 1 },
    { id: 2, name: "Bob Smith", pace: 450, van: 1 },
    { id: 3, name: "Carol Davis", pace: 480, van: 1 },
    { id: 4, name: "David Wilson", pace: 510, van: 1 },
    { id: 5, name: "Eva Brown", pace: 540, van: 1 },
    { id: 6, name: "Frank Miller", pace: 570, van: 1 },
    { id: 7, name: "Grace Lee", pace: 600, van: 2 },
    { id: 8, name: "Henry Taylor", pace: 630, van: 2 },
    { id: 9, name: "Ivy Chen", pace: 660, van: 2 },
    { id: 10, name: "Jack Anderson", pace: 690, van: 2 },
    { id: 11, name: "Kate Martinez", pace: 720, van: 2 },
    { id: 12, name: "Liam Thompson", pace: 750, van: 2 }
  ]
};
```

## Test Cases

### 1. Race State Detection Tests

#### Test Case 1.1: Manual Finish Time Triggers Next Runner Start
**Objective**: Verify that the next runner only starts when the user manually sets the finish time for the previous runner.

**Steps**:
1. Start a race with the test data
2. Have Runner 1 running (manually started)
3. Manually set finish time for Runner 1
4. Observe that Runner 2 automatically starts at the same time
5. Verify `getCurrentRunner()` returns Runner 2
6. Verify `getNextRunner()` returns Runner 3

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Runner 2 only starts when Runner 1's finish time is manually set
- ✅ No automatic start based on projected times
- ✅ Current runner display shows Runner 2
- ✅ Next runner display shows Runner 3

**Validation Criteria**:
```typescript
// Test validation
const currentRunner = getCurrentRunner(legs, new Date());
const nextRunner = getNextRunner(legs, new Date(), startTime);

assert(currentRunner?.id === 2, "Current runner should be Runner 2");
assert(nextRunner?.id === 3, "Next runner should be Runner 3");
```

#### Test Case 1.2: No Automatic Start Based on Projections
**Objective**: Verify that runners don't automatically start based on projected finish times.

**Steps**:
1. Start a race with the test data
2. Have Runner 1 running
3. Wait past the projected finish time without setting actual finish
4. Verify Runner 2 does NOT automatically start
5. Manually set finish time for Runner 1
6. Verify Runner 2 starts immediately

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No automatic start based on projected times
- ✅ Next runner only starts when previous runner's finish time is manually set
- ✅ Race state remains consistent

### 2. Next Runner Accuracy Tests

#### Test Case 2.1: Correct Next Runner Display
**Objective**: Verify that the correct next runner is always displayed.

**Steps**:
1. Set up race with test data
2. Progress through multiple legs
3. Verify next runner display at each step
4. Check for off-by-one errors

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Next runner is always the correct runner (not runner after next)
- ✅ No off-by-one errors in runner identification
- ✅ Consistent display across all devices

**Validation Criteria**:
```typescript
// Test validation
const currentRunner = getCurrentRunner(legs, new Date());
const nextRunner = getNextRunner(legs, new Date(), startTime);

if (currentRunner) {
  assert(nextRunner?.id === currentRunner.id + 1, 
    `Next runner should be ${currentRunner.id + 1}, got ${nextRunner?.id}`);
}
```

#### Test Case 2.2: Race Completion Handling
**Objective**: Verify proper handling when race is complete.

**Steps**:
1. Complete all 36 legs
2. Verify final state
3. Check next runner display

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Race completion is properly detected
- ✅ No next runner displayed when race is finished
- ✅ Appropriate completion message shown

### 3. Data Persistence Tests

#### Test Case 3.1: No Default Data Display After Team Load
**Objective**: Verify that default runner names are never displayed once a team is loaded.

**Steps**:
1. Set up race with custom runner names
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify runner names are preserved immediately
4. Check that "Runner 1, Runner 2..." names never appear

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Runner names preserved on refresh
- ✅ No temporary default names displayed at any point
- ✅ Data loads immediately with real names

**Validation Criteria**:
```typescript
// Test validation
const runners = useRaceStore.getState().runners;
const hasDefaultNames = runners.some(r => r.name.startsWith('Runner '));
assert(!hasDefaultNames, "No default runner names should be displayed after team load");
```

#### Test Case 3.2: Offline Data Persistence
**Objective**: Verify data persistence during offline scenarios.

**Steps**:
1. Set up race data
2. Go offline
3. Make changes to runner data
4. Go back online
5. Verify data sync

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Data preserved during offline period
- ✅ Changes synced when back online
- ✅ No data loss during network transitions

#### Test Case 3.3: localStorage Recovery
**Objective**: Verify localStorage backup and recovery.

**Steps**:
1. Set up race data
2. Clear race store
3. Trigger localStorage recovery
4. Verify data restoration

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Data recovered from localStorage
- ✅ Recent data prioritized over old data
- ✅ Graceful fallback to default data if needed

### 4. Conflict Resolution Tests

#### Test Case 4.1: Simple Conflict Resolution
**Objective**: Verify that conflicts are resolved by simply updating the data and saving it.

**Steps**:
1. Create a timing conflict between devices
2. Resolve the conflict by selecting the correct time
3. Verify data is updated and saved
4. Check that conflict is resolved without tracking

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Conflict resolved by updating data
- ✅ Data saved immediately after resolution
- ✅ No complex conflict tracking or history

**Validation Criteria**:
```typescript
// Test validation
const resolvedLeg = legs.find(leg => leg.id === conflictLegId);
assert(resolvedLeg[field] === selectedTime, "Data should be updated with selected time");
```

#### Test Case 4.2: Conflict Resolution Across Devices
**Objective**: Verify that conflict resolution works consistently across devices.

**Steps**:
1. Create identical conflicts on different devices
2. Resolve conflicts on different devices
3. Verify data consistency across devices

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Conflicts resolved consistently across devices
- ✅ Data remains synchronized
- ✅ No data corruption

#### Test Case 4.3: Conflict Resolution Performance
**Objective**: Verify that conflict resolution is fast and doesn't impact performance.

**Steps**:
1. Create multiple conflicts rapidly
2. Resolve conflicts quickly
3. Monitor performance impact

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Fast conflict resolution
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Smooth user experience

### 5. Multi-Device Synchronization Tests
